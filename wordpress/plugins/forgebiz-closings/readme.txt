forgebiz closings plugin gives allows small businesses to balance cash register transactions at the end of each day to properly track and record sales transactions

== Description ==


What is the purpose of forgebiz closings?
forgebiz aims to provide useful applications for small business with a focus on the WordPress platform.  Forgebiz closings is a simple application that small businesses can use to balance their registers when they close our a register.

I found the following description of the why/how of this on http://www.dummies.com/business/operations-management/how-to-balance-cash-register-transactions/

A business must balance cash register transactions at the end of each day to properly track and record sales transactions. This also helps to ensure that cashiers don’t pocket a business’s cash — cashiers must prove out (show that they have the right amount of cash in the register based on the daily sales transactions) the amount of cash, checks, and charges they took in during the day.
