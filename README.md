The build.xml is a file that will copy what is required for the wordpress plugin into the target directory

We need it to be in the structure that it is for development (GWT devmode) and docker for wordpress, also the plugin doesn't need any jar files, etc..  
The plugin zip gets too large with jar files (and they are not even used)
